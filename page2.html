    <div class="container">
        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 99%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Chief of the Boat on the USS Alabama, only ever referred to by his title, COB, distinguished himself among the crew that considered themselves loyal to the Commanding Officer (CO, Captain Ramsey).  COB is the principle enlisted advisor to the CO, keeping the CO apprised of situations (both existing and potential), practices, and procedures.[1] Primarily concerned with the welfare, morale, and utilization of enlisted personnel, COB serves as an administrative assistant to the Executive Officer (XO, Lieutenant Commander Hunter), but reports directly to the CO.[2]<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>COB displays many positive traits of a Navy leader, although he has some faults as well.  His body weight sets a poor example for the crew of the ship, as naval leaders are expected to be physically fit, but he does have the ability to honestly evaluate himself, acknowledging his weight problem, justifying that the XO need not worry because it is his last tour.[3] &nbsp;In his justification, however, he admits to overeating which could either suggest he does a poor job at handling stress (lack of adaptability), or it simply serves as a plot device to give COB and the XO an opportunity for a closed-door discussion about the CO’s leadership.[4][5] &nbsp;Other moments that suggest COB lacks the skills to adapt include his aggressive stance towards the XO, cussing the XO out even as COB backs him over the CO.  Accustomed to the CO’s leadership, he has trouble adjusting to the XO’s style.[6]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>COB’s defining moment in the film, however, is his response to the CO and XO each commanding COB to place the other under arrest after the XO does not concur with the CO’s order to launch.  His decision to place the CO under arrest reflects positively upon him.  It shows that he has developed a logical, orderly thought process that he exercises in an objective manner, as evidenced by his remarks to the XO, “The Captain can’t just replace you at will.  That was completely improper.  That’s why I did what I did—by the book.”[7] &nbsp;With this decision, he set a positive example for the crew of the Alabama, not expecting anyone else to stand up to the CO without doing so himself.[8] &nbsp;He is the first crew member to back the XO, paving the way for others to follow.  Although many of the crew lack the courage to stand up to authority, changing their loyalties with each siege of the conn, COB remains consistent.  From a personal standpoint, he has his doubts about whether the CO or XO is right about how to act on the EAM, and he clearly states his support of the CO’s style of leadership when he says “The Captain knows what his men need” and “[Either you or the Captain have] gotta bend, and it isn’t the skipper.”  This divided loyalty between the CO’s philosophy and the XO’s actions makes him one of the most complex characters in the film, and he expressly states that “half of me’s glad the Captain came back.  He could be right.”  Despite his internal conflict, he outwardly remains steadfast in his convictions that he made the right decision.[9]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Until COB resigns himself to the officer’s mess with the XO, his decisions are only ever justified as following the rules.  The XO discusses his own philosophy with COB about the moral justification for delaying the launch, and this appeals to COB’s human nature.  His concern for potential victims of a nuclear war and interest in keeping the hands of the Alabama crew clean provide COB the determination to participate enthusiastically in the XO’s counter-siege of the conn, thus displaying General Taylor’s identified leadership traits.[10]</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Although COB has plenty of his own flaws, he ultimately comes across as a good leader.  He understands his duties and acts appropriately with courage, conviction, and consistency.</div><br><div>

            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">LT Peter “Weps” Ince is the Weapons Officer aboard the USS Alabama, and a friend of the XO, LCDR Hunter.  Generally, he is a calm and rational individual who does things by the book and is loyal to CAPT Ramsey.  Early in the movie he follows the Captain’s orders without hesitation, and recommends others, particularly LCDR Hunter, do the same.  He even tells Hunter to “Let the Captain get to know you” rather than being more forward with his view of a situation where there was a fire in the galley and CAPT Ramsey elected to run a missile launch drill.   He is loyal to fault which is demonstrated when he agrees that Hunter needs time to authenticate a message that was cut off, but agrees to free Ramsey anyway who’s sole objective is to launch their missiles.  This is an important turn because Ramsey calls Weps key to the entire operation since he is the only one with the combination to the safe containing the tactical firing trigger to launch the missiles and his personal relationship with Hunter.  While communication in the operational environment is typically verbal, Weps does not speak much, and his communication comes mostly as the internal conflict he is wrestling with comes from facial and other bodily expression.[1] 
<br><br><div>After prodding by Hunter that “…we have other ships that can handle this, you can’t be influenced by the captain or anybody else.  You have to make up your own mind.... Do not open that safe Weps.  It’s up to you, you’re the only one who knows the combination it is up to YOU Weps.  It’s up to you.”  Here he understands what Kolenda stated, “Leadership is about trust: trust in the leader’s vision, trust in the leader’s competence and character, trust in the leader’s respect and care for those under his or her charge.”[2] &nbsp; He also applies some critical thinking and monitors the quality of both his own, Ramsey’s and Hunter’s thinking to determine rationality and orders.[3] &nbsp; Weps’ morals are revealed when he says, “He’s (Hunter) in command now!  If they order him to launch, we’ll launch, and we’ll blow ‘em all to hell.  But, I rather go down myself than get this one wrong.”  He knows this is not a simple right or wrong and it is more complicated than that.[4] &nbsp; He backs up this moral standpoint with excellent situational leadership when Ramsey orders him to open the safe containing the tactical firing trigger and holds a gun to his head while threatening to kill him.  He refuses at first, also knowing that if he is killed Ramsey cannot access the firing trigger and will be unable to launch his missiles.  It is only after Ramsey threatens to kill an innocent Petty Officer that Weps concedes and opens the safe to save that man’s life.  Ultimately his decision to delay and wait for authentication of the message that was cut off in transmission results in no missiles being launched and receipt of an authenticated message telling them not to launch.  With his desire to get the orders right and in standing up to Ramsey, Weps helped protect himself from the moral injury that would have occurred had he not waited for the transmission and unlocked the tactical firing trigger.  The impacts of this moral injury may have been more than he could have overcome due to the loss of innocent civilian life.[5]
