    <div class="container">
        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 99%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Chief of the Boat on the USS Alabama, only ever referred to by his title, COB, distinguished himself among the crew that considered themselves loyal to the Commanding Officer (CO, Captain Ramsey).  COB is the principle enlisted advisor to the CO, keeping the CO apprised of situations (both existing and potential), practices, and procedures.[1] Primarily concerned with the welfare, morale, and utilization of enlisted personnel, COB serves as an administrative assistant to the Executive Officer (XO, Lieutenant Commander Hunter), but reports directly to the CO.[2]<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>COB displays many positive traits of a Navy leader, although he has some faults as well.  His body weight sets a poor example for the crew of the ship, as naval leaders are expected to be physically fit, but he does have the ability to honestly evaluate himself, acknowledging his weight problem, justifying that the XO need not worry because it is his last tour.[3] &nbsp;In his justification, however, he admits to overeating which could either suggest he does a poor job at handling stress (lack of adaptability), or it simply serves as a plot device to give COB and the XO an opportunity for a closed-door discussion about the CO’s leadership.[4][5] &nbsp;Other moments that suggest COB lacks the skills to adapt include his aggressive stance towards the XO, cussing the XO out even as COB backs him over the CO.  Accustomed to the CO’s leadership, he has trouble adjusting to the XO’s style.[6]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>COB’s defining moment in the film, however, is his response to the CO and XO each commanding COB to place the other under arrest after the XO does not concur with the CO’s order to launch.  His decision to place the CO under arrest reflects positively upon him.  It shows that he has developed a logical, orderly thought process that he exercises in an objective manner, as evidenced by his remarks to the XO, “The Captain can’t just replace you at will.  That was completely improper.  That’s why I did what I did—by the book.”[7] &nbsp;With this decision, he set a positive example for the crew of the Alabama, not expecting anyone else to stand up to the CO without doing so himself.[8] &nbsp;He is the first crew member to back the XO, paving the way for others to follow.  Although many of the crew lack the courage to stand up to authority, changing their loyalties with each siege of the conn, COB remains consistent.  From a personal standpoint, he has his doubts about whether the CO or XO is right about how to act on the EAM, and he clearly states his support of the CO’s style of leadership when he says “The Captain knows what his men need” and “[Either you or the Captain have] gotta bend, and it isn’t the skipper.”  This divided loyalty between the CO’s philosophy and the XO’s actions makes him one of the most complex characters in the film, and he expressly states that “half of me’s glad the Captain came back.  He could be right.”  Despite his internal conflict, he outwardly remains steadfast in his convictions that he made the right decision.[9]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Until COB resigns himself to the officer’s mess with the XO, his decisions are only ever justified as following the rules.  The XO discusses his own philosophy with COB about the moral justification for delaying the launch, and this appeals to COB’s human nature.  His concern for potential victims of a nuclear war and interest in keeping the hands of the Alabama crew clean provide COB the determination to participate enthusiastically in the XO’s counter-siege of the conn, thus displaying General Taylor’s identified leadership traits.[10]</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Although COB has plenty of his own flaws, he ultimately comes across as a good leader.  He understands his duties and acts appropriately with courage, conviction, and consistency.</div><br><div>

            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">LT Peter “Weps” Ince is the Weapons Officer aboard the USS Alabama, and a friend of the XO, LCDR Hunter.  Generally, he is a calm and rational individual who does things by the book and is loyal to CAPT Ramsey.  Early in the movie he follows the Captain’s orders without hesitation, and recommends others, particularly LCDR Hunter, do the same.  He even tells Hunter to “Let the Captain get to know you” rather than being more forward with his view of a situation where there was a fire in the galley and CAPT Ramsey elected to run a missile launch drill.   He is loyal to fault which is demonstrated when he agrees that Hunter needs time to authenticate a message that was cut off, but agrees to free Ramsey anyway who’s sole objective is to launch their missiles.  This is an important turn because Ramsey calls Weps key to the entire operation since he is the only one with the combination to the safe containing the tactical firing trigger to launch the missiles and his personal relationship with Hunter.  While communication in the operational environment is typically verbal, Weps does not speak much, and his communication comes mostly as the internal conflict he is wrestling with comes from facial and other bodily expression.[1] 
<br><br><div>After prodding by Hunter that “…we have other ships that can handle this, you can’t be influenced by the captain or anybody else.  You have to make up your own mind.... Do not open that safe Weps.  It’s up to you, you’re the only one who knows the combination it is up to YOU Weps.  It’s up to you.”  Here he understands what Kolenda stated, “Leadership is about trust: trust in the leader’s vision, trust in the leader’s competence and character, trust in the leader’s respect and care for those under his or her charge.”[2] &nbsp; He also applies some critical thinking and monitors the quality of both his own, Ramsey’s and Hunter’s thinking to determine rationality and orders.[3] &nbsp; Weps’ morals are revealed when he says, “He’s (Hunter) in command now!  If they order him to launch, we’ll launch, and we’ll blow ‘em all to hell.  But, I rather go down myself than get this one wrong.”  He knows this is not a simple right or wrong and it is more complicated than that.[4] &nbsp; He backs up this moral standpoint with excellent situational leadership when Ramsey orders him to open the safe containing the tactical firing trigger and holds a gun to his head while threatening to kill him.  He refuses at first, also knowing that if he is killed Ramsey cannot access the firing trigger and will be unable to launch his missiles.  It is only after Ramsey threatens to kill an innocent Petty Officer that Weps concedes and opens the safe to save that man’s life.  Ultimately his decision to delay and wait for authentication of the message that was cut off in transmission results in no missiles being launched and receipt of an authenticated message telling them not to launch.  With his desire to get the orders right and in standing up to Ramsey, Weps helped protect himself from the moral injury that would have occurred had he not waited for the transmission and unlocked the tactical firing trigger.  The impacts of this moral injury may have been more than he could have overcome due to the loss of innocent civilian life.[5]

Ramsey can clearly and confidently articulate his team's goals and mission and can stand by his decisions, all most to a fault. Ramsey is also very decisive, once he makes up his mind on what the right thing to do is, he is not easily put off course.&nbsp; 
</div><div>Ramsey does not fare as well in the areas of Trust and Humility. Ramsey feels that Leadership is a unique and special role of individuals placed in command; he is unwilling to take the risk of placing decision making in the hands of his subordinates. Ramsey does not make it a practice to listen to his crew; he is not open-minded and is in-flexible when issuing directives. Ramsey claims to want Hunter to provide him with feedback, but, does not take criticism in stride; and views it as an assault on his character. Ramsey does not want his team to get comfortable with their position; he wants them to be on edge, ready to execute.[2]&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div><strong>What lesson can be drawn for the character and situation in the film as related to the course content, and can those lessons apply in the future?&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene Hackman (NAVY CAPT 0-6, Frank Ramsey) demands the superior performance of himself and his Sailors in all situations; he carries himself with a command presence built-in line with the history of Naval Submariners. Ramsey demands that his team understand their roles in supporting mission objectives. Ramsey clearly states, when any team member does not know how their role fits in with their teammates, the entire group is at risk, the better the team understands the big picture, the better they will work together [3]&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Commander of the Boat CAPT Ramsey has positional power, he is the traditional theory X leader and practices the authoritative and traditional management style. [4] At one point in the movie, he points out that his crew's mission is to protect Democracy not to practice it, meaning he was calling all the shots. &nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His years of real-world experience and earned rank are the sources of his power, and for these reasons, he believes he is the one/only individual capable of making the correct decision for his boat. Ramsey believes that followers perform the best when the chain of command is definite and clear; using this power, Ramsey dominates and controls the situations and individuals in his organization; he demands good order and disciple from his team. &nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey's role as a performance-based leader is to retain authority, dictate the way tasks should be performed, and make decisions without input from others. Ramsey expects that when he gives an order, his crew will follow it out. Based on the Hersey-Blanchard's situational leadership theory, Ramsey displays the Telling behavior, one-directional flow of information, from the leader to the group. He tells his crew precisely what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Ramsey can rationalize this behavior because of the situations dictated by specific time constraints, "The Time the Rebels will be ready to launch," and the complexity of the task, "launching the nuclear submarines."
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey is coercive and controlling and regularly threatens his subordinates' job security if their performance does not meet his standards. If something is out of order, he feels it must be dealt with promptly. If something is wrong and he does not make the corrections, he establishes a standard of behavior. [5] Accountability is a critical component in developing team members and building a team that will guarantee mission accomplishment [6]. Through these actions and practices, Ramsey cultivates obedience, instead of commitment from his officers.&nbsp; 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div><strong>Factors that empower and constrain leaders&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of power is a relevant leadership idea and can be both constraining and empowering. Leaders use their power to develop commitment or compliance from their workers/officers. Leaders trained under the old model of Leadership have low hopes of there subordinates and use power to govern and control their team members and place constraints to ensure that they remain in control. New leadership philosophies trained leaders tend to use more of the human-relations approaches to leaderships. The new school leaders place a higher level of responsibilities and solicit feedback from their employees by empowering them to participate in the leadership process. &nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies have shown that Situation leadership maybe be a more effective approach to running an organization. Direct supervision, regular monitoring, and frequent interaction have a more positive impact on lower-level employees. Higher-level employees responded better to a more considerate empowering approach.  &nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>A leader's role/action leading in an environment of changes&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey relies on the integrity of the chain of command to accomplish objectives that align with the mission. [7] As the leader, Ramsey has not established an open communication line with his subordinate leaders. When it is apparent that a direct subordinate has developed a different agenda, timely actions must remedy it. The first step is to gather all the facts and study the information carefully to confirm any unfavorable conduct; the condition needs validation. [8]. In the movie, Ramsey repeats that he wants feedback, but he does not listen when given.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ramsey does engage in a serious conversation with LCDR Hunter. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey is clear in communicating where he felt there were deviations from expected behaviors. Ramsey is not receptive to any reasoning for deviations by Hunter; it is not acceptable to have an agenda different from his Leadership. At the end of the conversation, Hunter is again encouraged to provide any ideas for improvement to Ramsey directly but must agree to follow all unit directives without exception. &nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most situations, communication is the biggest challenge. Communication must be appropriate, simple, real, and reliable. It should contain the justifications for the changeover, the blueprint for the change, what the mission requirements. Team members must be able to ask questions and receive answers during the process. [9] Leaders must stay focused on their teams and be accessible to help their teams; they must be available to listen with an open mind. The leader's actions are the most significant factor in establishing unit unity. The unit depends on the Commander for its attitude, its effort, and its way forward. [10] A successful leader can be hands-on at decisive points in time to influence the actions needed to drive change.[11]
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The ethical dimension of a leader's actions with respect to the operating environment?
</strong></div><div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">To effectively use the communications approaches described, a leader must create a foundation for the new team's interactions. By utilizing the leadership competency approaches associated with mental and interpersonal adaptability, the leaders can create a climate that facilitates the communication technic outlined.[12] By employing creative problem solving, a big part of mental adaptability, the leader can devise the strategies to best employ the team members. The leader must learn the experience levels and capabilities of each team member to develop an organizational structure to create the team's correct roles and assignments. [13] In this example, the leader must be knowledgeable of the joint planning processes. By exercising interpersonal adaptability, the leader will establish the basis for relationship building and effective interaction, which pave the way for the leaders to utilize the tactics of participation, rational persuasion, and collaboration. &nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always challenges in these types of environments. The development of cohesion is always tricky due to conflicts, tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP) from each of the different organizational branches, and the group's diversity.[14]  Sustaining positive morale becomes a challenge because of the high-stress time-consuming nature of the work performed. The development of a vision for the group becomes difficult, especially when planning for future operations. Everyone brings something different to the team, and the development of specific performance protocols can be challenging.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right leadership approach can help to overcome many operational challenges. The development of trust and goodwill through effective communication is vital for the overall success of the team. [15] Knowledge and experience working with joint and multi-agency partners is another critical predictor of a leader's adaptive performance, effective decision making in these situations requires specialized expertise.[16] Individuals with leadership ambitions, who have displayed the ability, should be placed in situations to develop the mental and educational skills that prepare them for leadership roles in these situations.
