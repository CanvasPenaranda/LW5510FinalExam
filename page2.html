    <div class="container">
        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 99%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Chief of the Boat on the USS Alabama, only ever referred to by his title, COB, distinguished himself among the crew that considered themselves loyal to the Commanding Officer (CO, Captain Ramsey).  COB is the principle enlisted advisor to the CO, keeping the CO apprised of situations (both existing and potential), practices, and procedures.[1] Primarily concerned with the welfare, morale, and utilization of enlisted personnel, COB serves as an administrative assistant to the Executive Officer (XO, Lieutenant Commander Hunter), but reports directly to the CO.[2]<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>COB displays many positive traits of a Navy leader, although he has some faults as well.  His body weight sets a poor example for the crew of the ship, as naval leaders are expected to be physically fit, but he does have the ability to honestly evaluate himself, acknowledging his weight problem, justifying that the XO need not worry because it is his last tour.[3] &nbsp;In his justification, however, he admits to overeating which could either suggest he does a poor job at handling stress (lack of adaptability), or it simply serves as a plot device to give COB and the XO an opportunity for a closed-door discussion about the CO’s leadership.[4][5] &nbsp;Other moments that suggest COB lacks the skills to adapt include his aggressive stance towards the XO, cussing the XO out even as COB backs him over the CO.  Accustomed to the CO’s leadership, he has trouble adjusting to the XO’s style.[6]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>COB’s defining moment in the film, however, is his response to the CO and XO each commanding COB to place the other under arrest after the XO does not concur with the CO’s order to launch.  His decision to place the CO under arrest reflects positively upon him.  It shows that he has developed a logical, orderly thought process that he exercises in an objective manner, as evidenced by his remarks to the XO, “The Captain can’t just replace you at will.  That was completely improper.  That’s why I did what I did—by the book.”[7] &nbsp;With this decision, he set a positive example for the crew of the Alabama, not expecting anyone else to stand up to the CO without doing so himself.[8] &nbsp;He is the first crew member to back the XO, paving the way for others to follow.  Although many of the crew lack the courage to stand up to authority, changing their loyalties with each siege of the conn, COB remains consistent.  From a personal standpoint, he has his doubts about whether the CO or XO is right about how to act on the EAM, and he clearly states his support of the CO’s style of leadership when he says “The Captain knows what his men need” and “[Either you or the Captain have] gotta bend, and it isn’t the skipper.”  This divided loyalty between the CO’s philosophy and the XO’s actions makes him one of the most complex characters in the film, and he expressly states that “half of me’s glad the Captain came back.  He could be right.”  Despite his internal conflict, he outwardly remains steadfast in his convictions that he made the right decision.[9]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Until COB resigns himself to the officer’s mess with the XO, his decisions are only ever justified as following the rules.  The XO discusses his own philosophy with COB about the moral justification for delaying the launch, and this appeals to COB’s human nature.  His concern for potential victims of a nuclear war and interest in keeping the hands of the Alabama crew clean provide COB the determination to participate enthusiastically in the XO’s counter-siege of the conn, thus displaying General Taylor’s identified leadership traits.[10]</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Although COB has plenty of his own flaws, he ultimately comes across as a good leader.  He understands his duties and acts appropriately with courage, conviction, and consistency.</div><br><strong>Notes</strong><br><div>

            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">LT Peter “Weps” Ince is the Weapons Officer aboard the USS Alabama, and a friend of the XO, LCDR Hunter.  Generally, he is a calm and rational individual who does things by the book and is loyal to CAPT Ramsey.  Early in the movie he follows the Captain’s orders without hesitation, and recommends others, particularly LCDR Hunter, do the same.  He even tells Hunter to “Let the Captain get to know you” rather than being more forward with his view of a situation where there was a fire in the galley and CAPT Ramsey elected to run a missile launch drill.   He is loyal to fault which is demonstrated when he agrees that Hunter needs time to authenticate a message that was cut off, but agrees to free Ramsey anyway who’s sole objective is to launch their missiles.  This is an important turn because Ramsey calls Weps key to the entire operation since he is the only one with the combination to the safe containing the tactical firing trigger to launch the missiles and his personal relationship with Hunter.  While communication in the operational environment is typically verbal, Weps does not speak much, and his communication comes mostly as the internal conflict he is wrestling with comes from facial and other bodily expression.[1] 
<br><br><div>After prodding by Hunter that “…we have other ships that can handle this, you can’t be influenced by the captain or anybody else.  You have to make up your own mind.... Do not open that safe Weps.  It’s up to you, you’re the only one who knows the combination it is up to YOU Weps.  It’s up to you.”  Here he understands what Kolenda stated, “Leadership is about trust: trust in the leader’s vision, trust in the leader’s competence and character, trust in the leader’s respect and care for those under his or her charge.”[2] &nbsp; He also applies some critical thinking and monitors the quality of both his own, Ramsey’s and Hunter’s thinking to determine rationality and orders.[3] &nbsp; Weps’ morals are revealed when he says, “He’s (Hunter) in command now!  If they order him to launch, we’ll launch, and we’ll blow ‘em all to hell.  But, I rather go down myself than get this one wrong.”  He knows this is not a simple right or wrong and it is more complicated than that.[4] &nbsp; He backs up this moral standpoint with excellent situational leadership when Ramsey orders him to open the safe containing the tactical firing trigger and holds a gun to his head while threatening to kill him.  He refuses at first, also knowing that if he is killed Ramsey cannot access the firing trigger and will be unable to launch his missiles.  It is only after Ramsey threatens to kill an innocent Petty Officer that Weps concedes and opens the safe to save that man’s life.  Ultimately his decision to delay and wait for authentication of the message that was cut off in transmission results in no missiles being launched and receipt of an authenticated message telling them not to launch.  With his desire to get the orders right and in standing up to Ramsey, Weps helped protect himself from the moral injury that would have occurred had he not waited for the transmission and unlocked the tactical firing trigger.  The impacts of this moral injury may have been more than he could have overcome due to the loss of innocent civilian life.[5]

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>Factors that empower and constrain leaders</strong><div>Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter enters the story as Captain Ramsey’s choice as his new XO. &nbsp;</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Their initial interview is a challenge to Hunter – Ramsey sees something in Hunter, that indefinable “spark” of leadership that General Taylor spoke of and chooses Hunter as his new XO. [1]  This initial interaction shows us that Hunter is unflappable – the interview is tense and awkward, landing on the topic of horses, unrelated to the mission at hand with strange jokes peppered throughout.  The Chief of the Boat stands silently at attention the entire time, only chuckling at the forced joke or speaking at the very end.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>It is here that we find Hunter practicing what Katzenbach et al. term, "the following part of leading” [2] – his willingness to listen and follow along with a leader, his urge to seek common grounds with an aggressive party – these are traits that Hunter has and that leaders in general would do well to strengthen.  Through extensive research, it is shown that simply leading is not what makes leaders and their organizations become stronger – it is through the practice of Servant Leadership that a leader truly empowers an organization.  As Greenleaf wrote, “The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead.” [3]&nbsp;</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Because he is new to the boat and has never served in a combat-oriented role, Hunter is ultimately constrained by his inexperience.  He uses this inexperience as a chance to listen and to learn. His desire to serve first eventually leads him to assuming the most powerful role on the ship.  Further, he takes his time as a servant leader to understand his fellow subordinates, which eventually empowers his takeover and prevents a nuclear holocaust from occurring.  As Spears explained, “Servant leadership seeks to involve others in decision making, is strongly based in ethical and caring behavior…” [4] We see multiple times that Hunter cares not only for his crew, but for the entirety of the human race.&nbsp; 
</div><div>
</div><div>Even so, XO Hunter runs headlong into and is constrained by the aggressive personality of Captain Ramsey.  This hostile dynamic between XO Hunter and Captain Ramsey eventually comes to a head with two mutinies, but we catch glimpses of it in early scenes.  In one such scene, XO Hunter seeks to boost the morale of the men on the ship – dipping into the values of a servant leader by attempting to bring his followers higher.  Captain Ramsey responds in this exchange:&nbsp;
</div><div>“Ramsey: May I have your attention, please. Mr. Hunter has brought it to my attention that morale may be a bit low, that you may be a bit...&nbsp;
</div><div>Hunter: On edge.&nbsp;
</div><div>Ramsey: ...on edge. So, I suggest this: Any crewmember who feels he can't handle the situation can leave the ship right now. Gentlemen, we are at DEFCON 3. War is imminent.” [5]
</div><div>XO Hunter’s attempts are shut down by the Captain’s dictatorial demands in an environment of fear.</div><br><div>

</div><div>We find that the environment that XO Hunter is entering is based on an earned fear – fear of nuclear war forces Captain Ramsey to run his ship as a dictator.  Captain Ramsey has love for his men and respects them, but he knows that the stakes at hand are so great that no person has room for error on his ship. During the initial call to man the boat, we hear this from Captain Ramsey:
</div><div>“Ramsey: Little ducks...there's trouble in Russia...so they called us. We're going over there and bringing the most lethal killing machine ever devised. We're capable of launching more firepower than has ever been released in the history of war for one purpose alone: to keep our country safe. We constitute the front line and the last line of defense. I expect and demand your very best…This might be our Commander-in-Chief's navy...but this is my boat! All I ask is that you keep up with me, and if you can't...that strange sensation you'll be feeling in the seat of your pants...will be my boot in your ass!” [6]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Even during the tense Officer’s dinner and the discussion of von Clausewitz, XO Hunter shows that a leader does not have to be spineless in order to be a good follower and servant.  He tactfully disagrees with Captain Ramsey and in turn says to all the Officers that, “In my humble opinion…in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.” [7] Hunter shows that leaders can and must understand the environment they are working in and the risks involved with being a leader under these constraints.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Hunter does his best to perform as a leader and servant in a high-stakes environment with a potential war that could start at any moment – he falls back on the first principal of Naval Leadership: “Know Yourself”. [8] He knows his limits and understands his role within the hierarchy of the ship – Hunter is able to stand fast even in the face of a Captain running his ship as a dictator and he does not blink. His position is secure.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>This dynamic, Captain Ramsey the Dictator against XO Hunter the Servant-Leader, becomes essential during the first mutiny.  As Col Aldridge wrote on dictators, “when followers are motivated by fear to do what their BOSS wants, they are being forced to comply through manipulation or coercion,” and that if a leader like Captain Ramsey “[relies] solely on the authority of your rank or the power of your position and depend on threats, intimidation, and fear to get the job done, you can force almost anybody to go through the motions of meeting your demands,” but you ultimately create followers who show “obedience with a residue of resentment [and] breed indignant, indifferent, and disloyal followers who never buy-in to their leadership.” [9] Most of the men are unwilling to follow Captain Ramsey’s commands during the mutiny, instead choosing XO Hunter as he has proven himself as a compassionate leader with a strong desire to dutifully serve his followers – they fear Captain Ramsey’s dictatorship and become disloyal as soon as they are able.  Many of these actions arise because of the difference in critical thinking between XO Hunter and Captain Ramsey.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>A leader’s critical thinking and decision-making skills</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Hunter shows himself as a critical thinker.  It is important to maintain the ability to critically think, especially when serving under a strong-willed leader like Captain Ramsey.  Guillot writes that one main facet of critical thinking is that it “is fully aware of and continually guards against the natural human tendency to self-deceive and rationalize to selfishly get what it wants.” [10]&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>As the story moves along, we see Captain Ramsey lose his capacity to critically think – he became laser focused on believing a nuclear war has started and that his boat needed to launch its missiles in retaliation.  Even in non-wartime scenarios, good leaders need to be able to pull themselves out of their horse blinders and ask themselves that all-important question: “Could I Be Wrong?” [11] Captain Ramsey refused to believe that he could be wrong about the situation which ultimately led to his downfall.&nbsp;</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>On problem-solving and decision-making, Zweibelson wrote that “military planning values uniformity, repetition, and the utility of hierarchical structures…procedures that worked in one conflict environment should work in others...” and that “design’s approach is…a holistic appreciation of adaptive systems, discredits repetition, and considers improvisation and adaptation far more useful for complex problem solving.” [12]  XO Hunter, by combining his critical thinking skills with his outsider’s approach to the situation, was able to prevent a nuclear war through reasoning.  Captain Ramsey, was locked into his position, believing that his decades of military planning and repetition of using force had prepared him for exactly this moment.  Leaders must be willing to take XO Hunter’s approach to high-stakes situations – take the time to critically think through a situation, approach a scenario not only with military doctrine, but with a holistic approach that tries to view as many angles as possible while searching for creative solutions.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>An area that XO Hunter failed in was his inability to determine the goals of the other Officers on the ship.  As Kouzes wrote, “in a difficult and tense situation…it‘s crucial to talk about desired outcomes and make every effort to get everyone aligned. Once you‘re working toward the same set of goals and operating by the same set of norms, you‘ll be less likely to second-guess each other‘s motives and more likely to understand, and less bothered by each other‘s working styles.” [13] Hunter failed to heed his and paid the price with the second mutiny.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>When taking command, especially in a contested, high-stress environment, leaders must ensure that they and their followers are working toward the same overarching goals – in this case, Hunter would have done well to explain the severity of the situation as quickly as possible to the other Officers and assuage their doubts toward the efficacy of his command and his desire for a good outcome for all.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Ethical dimensions of a leader’s actions with respect to the operating environment</strong></div><div>
</div><div>Lastly, we look at XO Hunter through an ethical lens.  Kouzes et al. proposed that good leaders must look toward the future in order to “remind others…so mired in the day-to-day details of work and life that they lose their bearings, that there is a larger purpose” [14] – this is especially true in this film. &nbsp;</div><br><div>
</div><div>The Sailors of the USS Alabama are sitting on the precipice of nuclear war – just like the Strategic Corporal’s decisions would directly impacting “the outcome of the larger operation” [15], the decisions made aboard the Alabama could potentially lead to nuclear war, Mutually Assured Destruction, and the death of humanity.  These facts weigh heavy on XO Hunter, just as the facts should weigh heavily on any leader.  XO Hunter was willing to mutiny in order to pull the Sailors out from their locked in positions – they had lost all their bearings and had forgotten that they were in a position to directly impact the entire conflict, potentially even to end the entire world.  Leaders must aim to think of the larger impact of their actions and not lose the sight of the forest for the trees.  XO Hunter keeps this in mind at all times and ensures that his actions do not lead to disproportionate retribution.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>On the aspect of proportionality in war, Swain et al. write in the Armed Forces Officer that “the harm done in any particular military operation should not outweigh the good accomplished by that military operation…it must not be disproportionate to the legitimate gains achieved by the military operation.” [16]
</div><div>
</div><div>Even in this environment of constraints, rapid change, lack of critical thought, and questionably ethical decisions, XO Hunter proves himself a capable leader in a wartime situation.  As Hamburger wrote, “native good judgment, or "common sense," is an absolute requirement for successful combat leadership…In particular, the leader must have a well-developed and practiced ability in making decisions under pressure.” [17] XO Hunter demonstrated his abilities to remain sound-minded and rational even with the intense pressure around him – mutiny, war, crewmates dying, these all raged around him and he kept his calm.  Though many leaders may not have to make life or death decisions on the fly in war, being able to think rationally and work within constraints will ensure the survival of your team and yourself no matter the situation.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Finally, we receive one of the most important aspects of this film - a moment of reflection from both XO Hunter and Captain Ramsey.  Kamena et al. considers reflection as a way of providing “perspective, which in turn facilitates a better understanding of “what” happened, and “why” things occurred as they did.” [18] &nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>Reflecting in this manner allows leaders to determine what actions they should take in the future which helps to nurture growth in a leader.  Captain Ramsey ultimately decides to retire early after reflecting on his lack of critical thinking and his near destruction of the world.  His further reflections showed him that XO Hunter had proved himself more than worthy of command which ended with Captain Ramsey fully endorsing him, regardless of their antagonistic relationship.  In the end, leaders must be willing to put aside their egos and self-reflect.  If they made a poor decision, they must be willing to admit to doing wrong and promote the followers that attempted to do right.&nbsp;</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Crimson Tide is an excellent case study of providing leadership while working within the constraints of a system, in a scenario with extreme change, where critical thinking is vital to the survival of an organization, and ethical dilemmas face a leader at every turn.  It is absolutely critical that leaders prepare themselves mentally for these kinds of challenges they may face.</div><br><div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>What elements of Leadership are displayed? Which are not?
</strong><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven elements of Leadership can help to develop success for anyone in a leadership role; Transparency, Learn from Failure, Trust, Confidence Decisiveness, Humility, Creativity. [1] Noted for our analysis, Leadership is the ingredient that makes all elements of an organization work together. In our analysis or CAPT Ramsey, he displays the elements of Confidence and Decisiveness. Ramsey can clearly and confidently articulate his team's goals and mission and can stand by his decisions, all most to a fault. Ramsey is also very decisive, once he makes up his mind on what the right thing to do is, he is not easily put off course.&nbsp; 
</div><div>Ramsey does not fare as well in the areas of Trust and Humility. Ramsey feels that Leadership is a unique and special role of individuals placed in command; he is unwilling to take the risk of placing decision making in the hands of his subordinates. Ramsey does not make it a practice to listen to his crew; he is not open-minded and is in-flexible when issuing directives. Ramsey claims to want Hunter to provide him with feedback, but, does not take criticism in stride; and views it as an assault on his character. Ramsey does not want his team to get comfortable with their position; he wants them to be on edge, ready to execute.[2]&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div><strong>What lesson can be drawn for the character and situation in the film as related to the course content, and can those lessons apply in the future?&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene Hackman (NAVY CAPT 0-6, Frank Ramsey) demands the superior performance of himself and his Sailors in all situations; he carries himself with a command presence built-in line with the history of Naval Submariners. Ramsey demands that his team understand their roles in supporting mission objectives. Ramsey clearly states, when any team member does not know how their role fits in with their teammates, the entire group is at risk, the better the team understands the big picture, the better they will work together [3]&nbsp;
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Commander of the Boat CAPT Ramsey has positional power, he is the traditional theory X leader and practices the authoritative and traditional management style. [4] At one point in the movie, he points out that his crew's mission is to protect Democracy not to practice it, meaning he was calling all the shots. &nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His years of real-world experience and earned rank are the sources of his power, and for these reasons, he believes he is the one/only individual capable of making the correct decision for his boat. Ramsey believes that followers perform the best when the chain of command is definite and clear; using this power, Ramsey dominates and controls the situations and individuals in his organization; he demands good order and disciple from his team. &nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey's role as a performance-based leader is to retain authority, dictate the way tasks should be performed, and make decisions without input from others. Ramsey expects that when he gives an order, his crew will follow it out. Based on the Hersey-Blanchard's situational leadership theory, Ramsey displays the Telling behavior, one-directional flow of information, from the leader to the group. He tells his crew precisely what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Ramsey can rationalize this behavior because of the situations dictated by specific time constraints, "The Time the Rebels will be ready to launch," and the complexity of the task, "launching the nuclear submarines."
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey is coercive and controlling and regularly threatens his subordinates' job security if their performance does not meet his standards. If something is out of order, he feels it must be dealt with promptly. If something is wrong and he does not make the corrections, he establishes a standard of behavior. [5] Accountability is a critical component in developing team members and building a team that will guarantee mission accomplishment [6]. Through these actions and practices, Ramsey cultivates obedience, instead of commitment from his officers.&nbsp; 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div><strong>Factors that empower and constrain leaders&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of power is a relevant leadership idea and can be both constraining and empowering. Leaders use their power to develop commitment or compliance from their workers/officers. Leaders trained under the old model of Leadership have low hopes of there subordinates and use power to govern and control their team members and place constraints to ensure that they remain in control. New leadership philosophies trained leaders tend to use more of the human-relations approaches to leaderships. The new school leaders place a higher level of responsibilities and solicit feedback from their employees by empowering them to participate in the leadership process. &nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies have shown that Situation leadership maybe be a more effective approach to running an organization. Direct supervision, regular monitoring, and frequent interaction have a more positive impact on lower-level employees. Higher-level employees responded better to a more considerate empowering approach.  &nbsp;</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>A leader's role/action leading in an environment of changes&nbsp;
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey relies on the integrity of the chain of command to accomplish objectives that align with the mission. [7] As the leader, Ramsey has not established an open communication line with his subordinate leaders. When it is apparent that a direct subordinate has developed a different agenda, timely actions must remedy it. The first step is to gather all the facts and study the information carefully to confirm any unfavorable conduct; the condition needs validation. [8]. In the movie, Ramsey repeats that he wants feedback, but he does not listen when given.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ramsey does engage in a serious conversation with LCDR Hunter. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramsey is clear in communicating where he felt there were deviations from expected behaviors. Ramsey is not receptive to any reasoning for deviations by Hunter; it is not acceptable to have an agenda different from his Leadership. At the end of the conversation, Hunter is again encouraged to provide any ideas for improvement to Ramsey directly but must agree to follow all unit directives without exception. &nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most situations, communication is the biggest challenge. Communication must be appropriate, simple, real, and reliable. It should contain the justifications for the changeover, the blueprint for the change, what the mission requirements. Team members must be able to ask questions and receive answers during the process. [9] Leaders must stay focused on their teams and be accessible to help their teams; they must be available to listen with an open mind. The leader's actions are the most significant factor in establishing unit unity. The unit depends on the Commander for its attitude, its effort, and its way forward. [10] A successful leader can be hands-on at decisive points in time to influence the actions needed to drive change.[11]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>The ethical dimension of a leader's actions with respect to the operating environment?
</strong></div><div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">To effectively use the communications approaches described, a leader must create a foundation for the new team's interactions. By utilizing the leadership competency approaches associated with mental and interpersonal adaptability, the leaders can create a climate that facilitates the communication technic outlined.[12] By employing creative problem solving, a big part of mental adaptability, the leader can devise the strategies to best employ the team members. The leader must learn the experience levels and capabilities of each team member to develop an organizational structure to create the team's correct roles and assignments. [13] In this example, the leader must be knowledgeable of the joint planning processes. By exercising interpersonal adaptability, the leader will establish the basis for relationship building and effective interaction, which pave the way for the leaders to utilize the tactics of participation, rational persuasion, and collaboration. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always challenges in these types of environments. The development of cohesion is always tricky due to conflicts, tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP) from each of the different organizational branches, and the group's diversity.[14]  Sustaining positive morale becomes a challenge because of the high-stress time-consuming nature of the work performed. The development of a vision for the group becomes difficult, especially when planning for future operations. Everyone brings something different to the team, and the development of specific performance protocols can be challenging.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right leadership approach can help to overcome many operational challenges. The development of trust and goodwill through effective communication is vital for the overall success of the team. [15] Knowledge and experience working with joint and multi-agency partners is another critical predictor of a leader's adaptive performance, effective decision making in these situations requires specialized expertise.[16] Individuals with leadership ambitions, who have displayed the ability, should be placed in situations to develop the mental and educational skills that prepare them for leadership roles in these situations.</div><br><div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The first is LT Bobby Dougherty, the ship’s supplies officer, who has served with CAPT Ramsey for years. His tendency for the harsh use of positional power is evidenced early on as he dresses down an enlisted sailor for failing to address him with proper military courtesies, then commands the troop to perform physical training when they can’t answer an erroneous trivia question about a military movie. While ‘command’ is a form a legitimate positional power where military leaders derive the right and obligation to make decisions, using it in this context is simply for his own entertainment and not a healthy or appropriate use. [1] Later, after the Akula attack, he applies strong coercion when he retreats to speak with CAPT Ramsey and scares two sailors into disobeying an order given to them by LCDR Hunter, a superior officer. [2] It is clear that LT Dougherty is a “dictator” style leader when dealing with those of lesser rank. [4] In this discussion with CAPT Ramsey, LT Dougherty starts the effort to undo the actions of LCDR Hunter and forcefully return CAPT Ramsey to command, ignoring the violation of Navy regulations that got him there. In this context, LT Dougherty violates Naval leadership principles by ignoring the chain of command. [5] After the discussion with CAPT Ramsey, LT Dougherty joins his fellow lieutenants to apply pressure and persuasion to their peer, LT Peter “WEPS” Ince, to convince him to restore CAPT Ramsey to command of the ship.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">LT Roy Zimmer, the ship’s communication officer, has also served with CAPT Ramsey for years and is quick to join LT Dougherty and the efforts to restore the Captain to command of the ship. He participates heavily in the persuasion against WEPS. However, throughout the persistent crisis of the ship’s damaged communications, LT Zimmer is strangely absent. Naval leadership does encourage leaders to avoid over-supervision, but one could argue that LT Zimmer’s energy in supporting CAPT Ramsey’s return to command would be better spent focusing on his communications mission and seeking the authoritative resolution to the question surrounding the fragmented Emergency Action Message (EAM).

He has the smallest role of the three lieutenants but participates in the activities being led by LT Dougherty. During the persuasion of WEPS, while LT Zimmer is using more emotional persuasion techniques, LT Westergaurd cites the precedent of executing orders in the absence of contravening orders. In this fog of war, the lieutenants exercise critical thinking about the courses of action at hand, but as opposed to focusing any energy to solving the communications problem, they decide on a course of action which involves ignoring LCDR Hunter’s authority.

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Ultimately, as evidenced by the final scenes in the movie, CAPT Ramsey and LCDR Hunter were both right and both wrong. The aforementioned lieutenants should have respectfully expressed their opinions to their superiors and then – as long as the orders were lawful – executed the orders of those appointed over them. The lieutenants turned what could have been a simple incarceration of a Captain into an on-going power struggle.
