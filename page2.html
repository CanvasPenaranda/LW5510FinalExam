    <div class="container">
        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 99%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 25%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Chief of the Boat on the USS Alabama, only ever referred to by his title, COB, distinguished himself among the crew that considered themselves loyal to the Commanding Officer (CO, Captain Ramsey).  COB is the principle enlisted advisor to the CO, keeping the CO apprised of situations (both existing and potential), practices, and procedures.[1] Primarily concerned with the welfare, morale, and utilization of enlisted personnel, COB serves as an administrative assistant to the Executive Officer (XO, Lieutenant Commander Hunter), but reports directly to the CO.[2]<br><br> 
<div>
</div><div>COB displays many positive traits of a Navy leader, although he has some faults as well.  His body weight sets a poor example for the crew of the ship, as naval leaders are expected to be physically fit, but he does have the ability to honestly evaluate himself, acknowledging his weight problem, justifying that the XO need not worry because it is his last tour.[3] &nbsp;In his justification, however, he admits to overeating which could either suggest he does a poor job at handling stress (lack of adaptability), or it simply serves as a plot device to give COB and the XO an opportunity for a closed-door discussion about the CO’s leadership.[4][5] &nbsp;Other moments that suggest COB lacks the skills to adapt include his aggressive stance towards the XO, cussing the XO out even as COB backs him over the CO.  Accustomed to the CO’s leadership, he has trouble adjusting to the XO’s style.[6]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>COB’s defining moment in the film, however, is his response to the CO and XO each commanding COB to place the other under arrest after the XO does not concur with the CO’s order to launch.  His decision to place the CO under arrest reflects positively upon him.  It shows that he has developed a logical, orderly thought process that he exercises in an objective manner, as evidenced by his remarks to the XO, “The Captain can’t just replace you at will.  That was completely improper.  That’s why I did what I did—by the book.”[7] &nbsp;With this decision, he set a positive example for the crew of the Alabama, not expecting anyone else to stand up to the CO without doing so himself.[8] &nbsp;He is the first crew member to back the XO, paving the way for others to follow.  Although many of the crew lack the courage to stand up to authority, changing their loyalties with each siege of the conn, COB remains consistent.  From a personal standpoint, he has his doubts about whether the CO or XO is right about how to act on the EAM, and he clearly states his support of the CO’s style of leadership when he says “The Captain knows what his men need” and “[Either you or the Captain have] gotta bend, and it isn’t the skipper.”  This divided loyalty between the CO’s philosophy and the XO’s actions makes him one of the most complex characters in the film, and he expressly states that “half of me’s glad the Captain came back.  He could be right.”  Despite his internal conflict, he outwardly remains steadfast in his convictions that he made the right decision.[9]</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Until COB resigns himself to the officer’s mess with the XO, his decisions are only ever justified as following the rules.  The XO discusses his own philosophy with COB about the moral justification for delaying the launch, and this appeals to COB’s human nature.  His concern for potential victims of a nuclear war and interest in keeping the hands of the Alabama crew clean provide COB the determination to participate enthusiastically in the XO’s counter-siege of the conn, thus displaying General Taylor’s identified leadership traits.[10]</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Although COB has plenty of his own flaws, he ultimately comes across as a good leader.  He understands his duties and acts appropriately with courage, conviction, and consistency.</div><br><div>
