<div>
</div><div>In the movie Crimson Tide, CAPT Ramsey (Gene Hackman) is the Commander of the submarine, USS Alabama, a ballistic nuclear submarine. Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) reports for duty to replace the Executive Officer who is out due to a bout with appendicitis. The USS Alabama receives orders to provide support for a rebel uprising in Russia. The rebels have taken control of Russian military bases that house nuclear weapons pointed at the United States, they also control the launch coder for these weapons. The USS Alabama is assigned to be prepared to deploy pre-emptive strikes against the Rebels before they can launch the missiles aimed at the United States. As the situation with the Rebels worsens, the USS Alabama receives a preliminary execution order and begins launch preparations. As this scenario is developing, USS Alabama engages with a hostile Russian Submarine, 
</div><div>USS Alabama suffers an indirect hit during the exchange. The radio communication is damaged as the crew is receiving a second message to either confirm the missile launch or abort the initial order. When CAPT Ramsey and LCDR Hunter disagree on how to handle the matter, the movie plot begins
</div><div>
</div><div>What elements of Leadership are displayed? Which are not?
</div><div>Seven elements of Leadership can help to develop success for anyone in a leadership role; Transparency, Learn from Failure, Trust, Confidence Decisiveness, Humility, Creativity. [1] Noted for our analysis, Leadership is the ingredient that makes all elements of an organization work together. In our analysis or CAPT Ramsey, he displays the elements of Confidence and Decisiveness. Ramsey can clearly and confidently articulate his team's goals and mission and can stand by his decisions, all most to a fault. Ramsey is also very decisive, once he makes up his mind on what the right thing to do is, he is not easily put off course.  
</div><div>Ramsey does not fare as well in the areas of Trust and Humility. Ramsey feels that Leadership is a unique and special role of individuals placed in command; he is unwilling to take the risk of placing decision making in the hands of his subordinates. Ramsey does not make it a practice to listen to his crew; he is not open-minded and is in-flexible when issuing directives. Ramsey claims to want Hunter to provide him with feedback, but, does not take criticism in stride; and views it as an assault on his character. Ramsey does not want his team to get comfortable with their position; he wants them to be on edge, ready to execute.[2] 
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>What lesson can be drawn for the character and situation in the film as related to the course content, and can those lessons apply in the future? 
</div><div>Gene Hackman (NAVY CAPT 0-6, Frank Ramsey) demands the superior performance of himself and his Sailors in all situations; he carries himself with a command presence built-in line with the history of Naval Submariners. Ramsey demands that his team understand their roles in supporting mission objectives. Ramsey clearly states, when any team member does not know how their role fits in with their teammates, the entire group is at risk, the better the team understands the big picture, the better they will work together [3] 
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp; As the Commander of the Boat CAPT Ramsey has positional power, he is the traditional theory X leader and practices the authoritative and traditional management style. [4] At one point in the movie, he points out that his crew's mission is to protect Democracy not to practice it, meaning he was calling all the shots.  
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>His years of real-world experience and earned rank are the sources of his power, and for these reasons, he believes he is the one/only individual capable of making the correct decision for his boat. Ramsey believes that followers perform the best when the chain of command is definite and clear; using this power, Ramsey dominates and controls the situations and individuals in his organization; he demands good order and disciple from his team.  
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Ramsey's role as a performance-based leader is to retain authority, dictate the way tasks should be performed, and make decisions without input from others. Ramsey expects that when he gives an order, his crew will follow it out. Based on the Hersey-Blanchard's situational leadership theory, Ramsey displays the Telling behavior, one-directional flow of information, from the leader to the group. He tells his crew precisely what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. Ramsey can rationalize this behavior because of the situations dictated by specific time constraints, "The Time the Rebels will be ready to launch," and the complexity of the task, "launching the nuclear submarines."
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp; Ramsey is coercive and controlling and regularly threatens his subordinates' job security if their performance does not meet his standards. If something is out of order, he feels it must be dealt with promptly. If something is wrong and he does not make the corrections, he establishes a standard of behavior. [5] Accountability is a critical component in developing team members and building a team that will guarantee mission accomplishment [6]. Through these actions and practices, Ramsey cultivates obedience, instead of commitment from his officers.  
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Factors that empower and constrain leaders 
</div><div>The understanding of power is a relevant leadership idea and can be both constraining and empowering. Leaders use their power to develop commitment or compliance from their workers/officers. Leaders trained under the old model of Leadership have low hopes of there subordinates and use power to govern and control their team members and place constraints to ensure that they remain in control. New leadership philosophies trained leaders tend to use more of the human-relations approaches to leaderships. The new school leaders place a higher level of responsibilities and solicit feedback from their employees by empowering them to participate in the leadership process.  
</div><div>Recent studies have shown that Situation leadership maybe be a more effective approach to running an organization. Direct supervision, regular monitoring, and frequent interaction have a more positive impact on lower-level employees. Higher-level employees responded better to a more considerate empowering approach.   
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>A leader's role/action leading in an environment of changes 
</div><div>Ramsey relies on the integrity of the chain of command to accomplish objectives that align with the mission. [7] As the leader, Ramsey has not established an open communication line with his subordinate leaders. When it is apparent that a direct subordinate has developed a different agenda, timely actions must remedy it. The first step is to gather all the facts and study the information carefully to confirm any unfavorable conduct; the condition needs validation. [8]. In the movie, Ramsey repeats that he wants feedback, but he does not listen when given.
</div><div>Ramsey does engage in a serious conversation with LCDR Hunter. 
</div><div>Ramsey is clear in communicating where he felt there were deviations from expected behaviors. Ramsey is not receptive to any reasoning for deviations by Hunter; it is not acceptable to have an agenda different from his Leadership. At the end of the conversation, Hunter is again encouraged to provide any ideas for improvement to Ramsey directly but must agree to follow all unit directives without exception.  
</div><div>In most situations, communication is the biggest challenge. Communication must be appropriate, simple, real, and reliable. It should contain the justifications for the changeover, the blueprint for the change, what the mission requirements. Team members must be able to ask questions and receive answers during the process. [9] Leaders must stay focused on their teams and be accessible to help their teams; they must be available to listen with an open mind. The leader's actions are the most significant factor in establishing unit unity. The unit depends on the Commander for its attitude, its effort, and its way forward. [10] A successful leader can be hands-on at decisive points in time to influence the actions needed to drive change.[11]
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The ethical dimension of a leader's actions with respect to the operating environment?
</div><div>
</div><div>To effectively use the communications approaches described, a leader must create a foundation for the new team's interactions. By utilizing the leadership competency approaches associated with mental and interpersonal adaptability, the leaders can create a climate that facilitates the communication technic outlined.[12] By employing creative problem solving, a big part of mental adaptability, the leader can devise the strategies to best employ the team members. The leader must learn the experience levels and capabilities of each team member to develop an organizational structure to create the team's correct roles and assignments. [13] In this example, the leader must be knowledgeable of the joint planning processes. By exercising interpersonal adaptability, the leader will establish the basis for relationship building and effective interaction, which pave the way for the leaders to utilize the tactics of participation, rational persuasion, and collaboration. 
</div><div>
</div><div>There are always challenges in these types of environments. The development of cohesion is always tricky due to conflicts, tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP) from each of the different organizational branches, and the group's diversity.[14]  Sustaining positive morale becomes a challenge because of the high-stress time-consuming nature of the work performed. The development of a vision for the group becomes difficult, especially when planning for future operations. Everyone brings something different to the team, and the development of specific performance protocols can be challenging.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;The right leadership approach can help to overcome many operational challenges. The development of trust and goodwill through effective communication is vital for the overall success of the team. [15] Knowledge and experience working with joint and multi-agency partners is another critical predictor of a leader's adaptive performance, effective decision making in these situations requires specialized expertise.[16] Individuals with leadership ambitions, who have displayed the ability, should be placed in situations to develop the mental and educational skills that prepare them for leadership roles in these situations.
